## Naive implementations of Lattice-based Signature Schemes

 - Lattice signature without trapdoors using unimodal discrete Gaussian (Lyubashevsky, 2012)
 - Lattice signature using bimodal discrete Gaussian (Ducas, Lyubashevsky, et. al., 2013)

One must have SageMath (with Sage libraries in the PATH) to run these files.
